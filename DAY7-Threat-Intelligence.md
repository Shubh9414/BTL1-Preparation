# Day 7 Threat Intelligence

## Focus: Operational Threat Intelligence + MISP Lab

Today’s learning was centered around the role of a Cyber Threat Intelligence Analyst and the practical aspects of Operational Threat Intelligence. The focus was on identifying early indicators and adversary precursors, applying threat models, and utilizing platforms like MISP for IOC research and sharing.

## Topics Covered

### Operational Threat Intelligence

- Understanding how precursors (early-stage indicators) can provide defenders with warning signals

- Role of CTI analysts in adversary tracking, behavior analysis, and reporting

### Frameworks Explored

- MITRE ATT&CK Framework – TTP-based adversary modeling

- Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill Chain – Structured attacker lifecycle

- Unified Kill Chain – Bridging MITRE and Kill Chain into one comprehensive view

### Threat Intelligence Models

- Pyramid of Pain – Emphasizing what hurts adversaries most (e.g., TTPs > IPs)

- Tactical Threat Intelligence – Day-to-day actionable insights

### Threat Intelligence Platforms (TIPs)

- Difference between paid feeds and OSINT

- Overview of commercial TIPs (e.g., Anomali, Recorded Future)

- Focused use of MISP as an open-source TIP

## Practical Lab: MISP Threat Intelligence Exercise

- Used MISP to search and investigate ransomware groups (e.g., LockBit)

- Researched DDOS campaign IOCs

- Identified relevant threat actors, indicators, and tags using MISP UI

- Learned to navigate events, tags, and search functionality in MISP

## Intelligence Classification

### TLP – Traffic Light Protocol

- TLP:RED, TLP:AMBER, TLP:GREEN, TLP:WHITE

- Guides how shared intelligence can be distributed

### PAP – Permissible Action Protocol

Defines what actions can be taken with the shared intelligence

Often complements TLP in formal intelligence sharing

## Tasks Completed

- All module quizzes

- Threat Intelligence Lab using MISP

- Updated GitHub with APT28 simulation and IOC event

## Reflection

Today helped bridge the theoretical side of CTI frameworks with the practical usage of a Threat Intelligence Platform (MISP). Creating, navigating, and investigating threat events and actor profiles simulated the role of an actual CTI analyst. It also made it clear how important proper classification (TLP, PAP) is when handling and distributing intelligence.
