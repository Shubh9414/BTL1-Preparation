# DAY1
Today I learned about the different types of security controls **physical, Network, Email and endpoint security control** and how each one fits into real-world scenarios.

Also, I appreciated that the course talked about soft skills and mental health. Topics like burnout and imposter syndrome hit hard I’ve felt those at times when I doubted my own progress. It’s good to see that acknowledged in a technical course.

And at last had a quiz on security controls which gave me uestions on how i would deal with situations and what the terms mean what kind of things come under different controls.

This wasn’t a “hands-on” day, but it gave me clarity on where I stand and what kind of mindset I need to build as a Blue Teamer.
