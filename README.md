# Blue Team Level 1 (BTL1) â€“ Full Preparation Journey

## Overview

This repository documents my complete journey through the **Security Blue Team â€“ BTL1 Certification**. The program provided structured and hands-on exposure to real-world Blue Team operations such as threat detection, digital forensics, incident response, threat intelligence, and SIEM investigations.

While I had prior theoretical exposure through Security+ and tools experience, this course gave me **practical, tool-based knowledge** and **realistic Blue Team thinking** that enhanced my skills dramatically.

## ðŸ“š What I Learned

### Practical Understanding of a Blue Team Analystâ€™s Role
- The workflow of an analyst: detection â†’ triage â†’ investigation â†’ response
- How collaboration with Legal, HR, C-Suite, and Threat Intelligence strengthens incident response
- Writing professional reports, summaries, and IOCs for handover or audit

### Real-World Labs (Each Backed by Documentation)
- 13 full days of labs, ranging from basic forensic triage to building dashboards and writing Sigma rules
- Created and analyzed malicious network traffic
- Investigated insider threats, logins outside working hours, and malware infections

### New Commands & Techniques Gained
- PowerShell & CMD for live triage (`Get-WinEvent`, `netstat`, `tasklist`)
- Volatility commands for memory extraction
- Linux investigation (auth.log, bash_history, shadow/passwd)
- IOC creation and usage in real IR tools
