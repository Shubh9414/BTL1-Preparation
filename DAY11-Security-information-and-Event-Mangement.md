# DAY11 Security information and event management

## SIEM Practical Labs Splunk, Queries, and Dashboards

Today marked the final day of the SIEM module, which was fully practical and packed with five hands-on Splunk labs. These labs helped reinforce my understanding of how to investigate real security events and build meaningful dashboards using search queries.

## Labs Summary

Each lab was structured to be approximately 60 minutes long and progressively introduced more advanced tasks first for today had some basic query writing to identify logs of URL had fortigate suracata xmleventlogs aggrefgated which i navigated bsed on what was required last lab was the most time consuming which was on about writing custom queries to find alerts in these logs and navigate to find the src ip looking for what scanner was used and also if you get url you can search for it on virus total more information on it also some CVE-CVSS alerts were also there which i needed to verify there CVSS score on (NVD)National vulnerability database.

## Skills Practiced

- Navigating Splunk Web UI

- Building and saving dashboards

- Writing search queries with SPL (Search Processing Language)

- Translating detection logic into actionable rules

- Enhancing visualization for analysts

## Screenshots Captured

## Reflection

Today was a true hands-on SIEM experience, and helped solidify the way Splunk can be used for security investigation, reporting, and detection logic. The SIGMA rule writing in particular stood out as a valuable, vendor-agnostic skill. These labs offered a glimpse into real SOC work, preparing me to confidently work with live log data in Splunk or other SIEMs.
