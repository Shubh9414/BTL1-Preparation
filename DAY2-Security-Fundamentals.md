# DAY2
Most of today’s content reinforced areas I was already familiar with, especially around networking fundamentals. However, there were a few new and valuable concepts that stood out:

## What I Learned Today:
Management principles and risk response strategies especially how concepts like mitigation, acceptance, and transfer align with real-world decisions in cybersecurity.

Overview of key compliance frameworks like GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS and how they drive security requirements at the organizational level.

A solid introduction to Active Directory (AD) this was very interesting. I got to explore:

- Domain structures and Organizational Units (OUs)

- How Group Policy Objects (GPOs) are applied to manage user and system behavior across the domain

## Hands-On:
I really enjoyed the final lab on building a basic Active Directory setup. It was my first time using GPOs and running domain-related commands — and it helped make AD feel more concrete.
