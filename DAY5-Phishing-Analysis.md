# Day 5 – Report Writing & Email Artifact Analysis

## Overview

Today was a significant milestone in my Blue Team journey as I explored the foundational skill of **incident report writing** — a core responsibility in any SOC or defensive security role.

Report writing is not just about documentation; it's a critical tool for:
- Ensuring **clarity and continuity** during ongoing investigations
- Helping others in the team **pick up where you left off** who aren't related to the project.
- Creating an **auditable trail** that supports accountability and compliance
- Improving visibility across detection, response, and post-incident review phases

## What I Learned

- The **structure** of a professional incident report
- Importance of clearly presenting:
  - Email headers and artifacts collected
  - Description
  - Analysis done and Tools used
  - Actions along with reasons  
- Writing with a **neutral and technical tone**
- How to ensure the report is both **useful for teammates** and **ready for auditors**

## Lab Work

Completed a hands-on lab focused on:
- Analyzing a phishing email from scratch
- Identifying and extracting key **email, web, and file artifacts**
- Determining whether the email was **malicious** based on contextual and technical evidence
- Writing a detailed **phishing investigation report**

### Reflection

- My **first version** of the report was functional but needed better structure and clarity
- On the **second attempt**, I significantly improved the language, formatting, and tone, bringing it closer to professional standards [Report.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/20628408/Report.pdf)
- I now understand how to **write reports that are useful, accurate, and structured for real-world use**
